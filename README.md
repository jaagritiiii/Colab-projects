# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

## Problem Statement

In the modern digital age, credit card fraud has become a significant concern for both financial institutions and consumers. Criminals are constantly developing new ways to commit fraudulent transactions, which can result in substantial financial losses. This project addresses the critical issue of credit card fraud detection by utilizing machine learning techniques.

The objective is to build a highly accurate credit card fraud detection model that can identify fraudulent transactions with precision. The dataset contains various features related to credit card transactions, and we will employ logistic regression to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

## Tech Stack Used

This project makes use of the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the machine learning model and analysis.

- **Google Colab**: The platform used for developing and running the project. It provides access to powerful computational resources and a Jupyter Notebook environment.

- **Scikit-Learn**: A powerful machine learning library in Python for building and evaluating machine learning models.

- **Pandas**: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Numpy**: A fundamental library for numerical operations in Python.

## Model Accuracy

The credit card fraud detection model has achieved an impressive accuracy score of 96% on both the training and testing data. This high accuracy ensures that the model can effectively identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card transactions, including various features such as transaction amount, time, and more. The dataset also includes a binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## Key Functions and Operations

In this project, we use several key functions and operations to preprocess the data and build the machine learning model:

- **Groupby**: The `groupby` function is used to aggregate and summarize data, allowing us to calculate statistics or apply functions on specific groups within the dataset. In the context of credit card fraud detection, it can be used to analyze patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions.

- **Train-Test Split**: We use the `train_test_split` function to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. This is crucial for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

- **Value Counts**: The `value_counts()` function is used to count the occurrences of unique values in a specific column, helping us understand the distribution of fraudulent and legitimate transactions in the dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **1. Data Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning the dataset, including handling missing values and standardizing features.

- **2. Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

- **3. Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's performance.

- **4. Model Building**: Training the Logistic Regression model to predict fraudulent transactions.

- **5. Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **6. Results**: Presenting the results of the credit card fraud detection model and discussing potential improvements and future work.
